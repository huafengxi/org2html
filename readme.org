#+Title: org2html

This is a single file script, just copy =org2html.py= to anywhere you like.

convert =a.org= to html byï¼š
: cat a.org | ./org2html.py

It is a very short script, just serve my needs(render simple blog like documents).

It is not tested by complex org file. see =org2an.py= if you want to convert =a.org= to other format.

see also [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js]], a javascript library doing the same thing.
